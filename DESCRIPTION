Description: A method for registering curves (functional data) that are generated from exponential family distributions.  This 
    implements the algorithms described in 'Wrobel et al. (2019)' <doi:10.1111/biom.12963>. Curve registration is an active area of 
    research in functional data analysis, and can be used to better understand patterns in functional data by separating curves 
    into phase and amplitude variability. This software handles both binary and continuous functional data, and is
    especially applicable in accelerometry and wearable technology.
