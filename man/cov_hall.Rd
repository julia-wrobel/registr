\usage{
cov_hall(
  Y,
  index_evalGrid,
  Kt = 25,
  Kc = 10,
  family = "gaussian",
  diag_epsilon = 0.01,
  make_pd = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{Y}{Dataframe. Should have values id, value, index.}

\item{index_evalGrid}{Grid for the evaluation of the covariance structure.}

\item{Kt}{Number of P-spline basis functions for the estimation of the
marginal mean. Defaults to 25.}

\item{Kc}{Number of marginal P-spline basis functions for smoothing the
covariance surface. Defaults to 10.}

\item{family}{One of \code{c("gaussian","binomial","gamma","poisson")}.
Poisson data are rounded before performing
the GFPCA to ensure integer data, see Details section below.
Defaults to \code{"gaussian"}.}

\item{diag_epsilon}{Small constant to which diagonal elements of the
covariance matrix are set if they are smaller. Defaults to 0.01.}

\item{make_pd}{Indicator if positive (semi-)definiteness of the returned
latent covariance should be ensured via \code{Matrix::near_PD()}. Defaults to
TRUE.}
}
\value{
Covariance matrix with dimension \code{time_evalGrid x time_evalGrid}.
}
\description{
Internal function for the estimation of the covariance matrix of the latent
process using the approach of Hall et al. (2008). Used in the
two-step GFPCA approach implemented in \code{\link{gfpca_twoStep}}. \cr \cr
This function is an adaptation of the implementation of Jan
Gertheiss and Ana-Maria Staicu for Gertheiss et al. (2017), with focus on
higher (RAM) efficiency for large data settings.
}
\details{
The implementation deviates from the algorithm described in Hall (2008) in
one crucial step -- we compute the crossproducts of \emph{centered}
observations and smooth the surface of these crossproducts directly instead
of computing and smoothing the surface of crossproducts of uncentered
observations and subsequently subtracting the (crossproducts of the) mean
function. The former seems to yield smoother eigenfunctions and 
fewer non-positive-definite covariance estimates.

If the data \code{Y} or the crossproduct matrix contain more than
\code{100,000} rows or elements, the estimation of the marginal mean or
the smoothing step of the covariance matrix are performed by
using the discretization-based estimation algorithm in \code{\link[mgcv]{bam}}
rather than the \code{\link[mgcv]{gam}} estimation algorithm.
